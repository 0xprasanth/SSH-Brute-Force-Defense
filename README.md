# SSH-Brute-Force-Defense
This project aims to analyze SSH failed login attempts on a CentOS VM to detect and mitigate brute-force attacks.
# Project Purpose:

This project aims to analyze SSH failed login attempts on a CentOS Virtual Machine (VM) to detect and mitigate brute-force attacks.

# Importance of SSH Security:

SSH (Secure Shell) is a critical protocol for remote access and secure communication with servers. Compromised SSH access can have severe consequences, 
including:

Data Breaches: Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored on the server.
System Control: Attackers can gain control of the server, allowing them to install malware, launch further attacks, or disrupt services.
Denial of Service (DoS): Constant brute-force attempts can overwhelm the server and make it inaccessible for legitimate users.
Mitigating Brute-Force Attacks

By analyzing SSH logs and identifying suspicious activity, this project aims to help system administrators proactively detect and mitigate brute-force attacks, enhancing the security of their CentOS VMs
